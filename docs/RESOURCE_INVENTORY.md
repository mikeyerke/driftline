# Driftline resource inventory

This inventory is intentionally scoped to the isolated Google Cloud project
`driftline-hackathon-2026`. The active gcloud configuration was checked during
the release run:

```text
core.account: mikeyerke@gmail.com
core.project: driftline-hackathon-2026
project number: 724959673622
```

Before any future mutation, verify the target explicitly:

```bash
gcloud config set project driftline-hackathon-2026
test "$(gcloud config get-value project 2>/dev/null)" = driftline-hackathon-2026
```

Cloud Build ID `8c339b36-d137-4c8a-b4d6-2039a0ce31d5` completed successfully
in `global` and deployed revision `driftline-00037-6nd` with the Jira gateway
environment and `driftline-jira-token:latest` Secret Manager binding from the
checked-in `cloudbuild.yaml`. Credential rotation then created revision
`driftline-00038-tbj` with the six-month token version active. The exact
verified image digest is
`sha256:5149de8e4b9804938c358b7edb58f8aade301350bb803d5de8e2b2dbd566f3b1`.
Cloud Build and Cloud Run may enable Google-managed dependency APIs in addition
to the six explicitly requested application APIs; no Driftline code uses the
unrelated managed services. No existing project, bucket, database, service
account, API key, repository, or environment variable is reused.

## Verified live evidence

The current public release was built from runtime commit `edc28cf` and was
exercised on revision `driftline-00028-7wt`:

- `GET /health` returned `{"status":"ok","service":"driftline-agent","persistence":"firestore","async_jobs":true}`.
- Two public deterministic competitor demos created workflows
  `42ef1bf4-f1bf-4808-8d8d-2c6bef87efdd` and
  `48969538-53b9-4994-aafc-c04e440e67de`; both reached `await_approval`, were
  approved, and were undone. Each approval action persisted in Firestore with
  `jira_status=not_configured` and `external_write=false`; each undo persisted
  a separate rollback marker and returned the workflow to `needs_approval`.
  This proves the new connector boundary is observable and does not pretend to
  have performed an external write.
- A logged-out browser run completed the async scan at desktop width and at a
  true 390px device viewport; both had `bodyScrollWidth === innerWidth` and no
  horizontal overflow.
- The prior public-pricing verification (on the immediately preceding
  code-equivalent release) reached `needs_approval` and created workflow
  `b3fea38e-2f47-4cfb-af4c-b95ca518becf`.
  The persisted job recorded `model=gemini-3.5-flash`,
  `execution_mode=google_adk`, and only the allowlisted tools
  `inspect_source_change` and `get_workflow_state`; the source mode was
  `public_source` with a pinned snapshot URL and hash. The trace recorded
  `analysis.mode=gemini_structured`, a model summary/rationale, the matching
  evidence hash, and four artifacts. Approval created Firestore action record
  `action-e9d4c4d90442` (`active`), wrote a versioned packet object, and undo
  changed that same record to `reversed` while writing a rollback marker. The
  first action item was claimed and completed by the named human demo actor;
  its idempotency key and evidence hash remained attached through the lifecycle.
- That browser flow covered source-evidence modal, artifact selection, the
  deterministic human approval gate, per-artifact outcomes (`packet_ready`,
  `owner_review`, and `queued`), the evidence-bound sandbox packet, activity
  audit, and reopen/undo. The packet explicitly recorded that no external
  system was changed.
- Direct Firestore REST inspection for that run found the matching job document, workflow
  document, and eight-document `audit_events` subcollection. Approval
  synchronized the job to `complete`; reopening synchronized it back to
  `needs_approval`.
- A signed Cloud Scheduler run previously created monitor job `job-9668cbe22717`, which
  completed `baseline_established` with no workflow or approval invented. The
  Firestore snapshot ledger contains one `public/pricing` baseline document.
- A signed Scheduler run previously created monitor job
  `job-acc5973e452d`, completed `unchanged`, and created no workflow.
- A controlled ledger replay previously created monitor job `job-2813b664a871`, which
  detected `changed` with the exact before/after sentences and
  `confidence=0.99`, then reached the same deterministic approval gate. Its
  explicit structured-analysis fallback was safe and labelled; the final
  judge-facing demo run above is the verified `gemini_structured` path.
- The source registry now exposes a second realistic public source type,
  `public/terms`, with its own pinned fixture and independent snapshot key;
  the console shows both bounded monitors without exposing arbitrary URL input.
- The release also exposes three bounded competitor change types:
  `competitor/pricing`, `competitor/offerings`, and `competitor/blog`. A live
  logged-out run of `competitor/pricing` completed through the Google ADK path
  with `gemini-3.5-flash`, rendered a source-to-offering-to-business-impact
  graph, prepared target-specific Confluence/Jira/Slack handoff manifests, and
  paused on the deterministic competitive-response approval gate. The run
  created four competitor artifacts (Comparison map, Pricing battlecard, Deal
  desk guidance, and Executive weekly brief); the first action was claimed and
  completed by the named Demo operator. No external system write was claimed.
- The live competitor run on the current revision used job
  `job-3af8cbf0d1c2`, workflow `a2877c66-7de7-4341-b511-c67b702d3ae4`, and
  reached `needs_approval` with `model=gemini-3.5-flash`,
  `execution_mode=google_adk`, and only `inspect_source_change` and
  `get_workflow_state`. The persisted evidence hash was
  `3b2df1ed8f635d1cc7ab425f675df0baa9bac941aaeddbfbca81ecada501d957` and
  the structured analysis reported four artifacts. Approval created action
  `action-2fa6eea0d92f` and a real isolated Google Cloud operational output at
  `gs://driftline-artifacts-724959673622/operational-outputs/a2877c66-7de7-4341-b511-c67b702d3ae4/action-2fa6eea0d92f/approved.md`.
- Undo on that same live workflow wrote the reversal marker
  `gs://driftline-artifacts-724959673622/operational-outputs/a2877c66-7de7-4341-b511-c67b702d3ae4/action-2fa6eea0d92f/reversed.json` and left the original approved object intact.
- A signed Scheduler run on the current revision created monitor job
  `job-19b95cca8363`, completed `unchanged`, and the append-only history API
  returned its Firestore observation at
  `/api/sources/public/pricing/history`. A second signed run,
  `job-19e3895ac2f7`, also completed `unchanged`; the history endpoint now
  returns two distinct immutable observations for the same source hash.
- The artifact bucket is isolated from Cloud Build buckets and has no public
  IAM members. A successful approval writes a packet object; undo writes a
  separate rollback marker so the original object remains versioned evidence.
- The deployed Jira adapter is enabled only in the isolated Driftline runtime
  and is scoped to the free `KAN` / `Driftline` project. It uses a Jira-scoped
  Atlassian token through the required `api.atlassian.com/ex/jira/<cloudId>`
  gateway, performs marker-based idempotent create/reuse, and reverses by
  appending a comment plus `driftline-reversed` label rather than deleting
  customer work. The live approval smoke test on revision
  `driftline-00036-vnm` created `KAN-1` with
  `jira_status=created` and `external_write=true`; the live undo returned
  `jira_status=reversed`, left the issue intact, changed labels to
  `driftline-reversed`, and appended one reversal comment. The token value is
  not present in the repository, browser frontend, or documentation.
  The reproducibility deploy then repeated the complete round trip on
  `driftline-00038-tbj`: workflow
  `26ef9a10-22df-4e39-be0f-13a7ffd04d76` created `KAN-3` and undo returned
  `jira_status=reversed` with `external_write=true`.
- Historical release notes: the first post-deploy live run exposed and fixed an
  ADK mode incompatibility;
  one subsequent enqueue returned a transient queue-not-found while the
  service was warming. The final run succeeded; treat Cloud Run error logs as
  a release gate before submission.

The public live-agent endpoint is configured for at most 10 calls per hour and a
2,000-character query. Demo starts and approval/undo writes share a 30-mutation
hourly cap. These are spend guards, not production authentication.

## Cleanup and disablement

The following commands target only the Driftline project. Review the inventory
before running destructive commands and never paste credentials or tokens into
the repository:

```bash
PROJECT=driftline-hackathon-2026
REGION=us-central1

gcloud scheduler jobs delete driftline-monitor --project="$PROJECT" --location="$REGION"
gcloud iam service-accounts delete driftline-scheduler@$PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com --project="$PROJECT"
gcloud run services delete driftline --project="$PROJECT" --region="$REGION"
gcloud tasks queues delete driftline-jobs --project="$PROJECT" --location="$REGION"
gcloud artifacts repositories delete driftline --project="$PROJECT" --location="$REGION"
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://724959673622-us-central1-cloudbuild-logs
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://driftline-hackathon-2026_us-central1_cloudbuild
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://driftline-hackathon-2026_cloudbuild
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://driftline-artifacts-724959673622
gcloud firestore databases delete --database='(default)' --project="$PROJECT"
gcloud projects delete "$PROJECT"
```

Project deletion is irreversible and should be the final reviewed action. The
free trial closes automatically on 2026-11-17 unless the full paid account is
activated; do not click the Cloud Console “Activate” upsell while the project
is no longer needed.
