# Driftline resource inventory

This inventory is intentionally scoped to the isolated Google Cloud project
`driftline-hackathon-2026`. The active gcloud configuration was checked during
the release run:

```text
core.account: mikeyerke@gmail.com
core.project: driftline-hackathon-2026
project number: 724959673622
```

Before any future mutation, verify the target explicitly:

```bash
gcloud config set project driftline-hackathon-2026
test "$(gcloud config get-value project 2>/dev/null)" = driftline-hackathon-2026
```

Cloud Build ID `775d0bab-aebd-4985-b7ae-59e515c0fcda` completed successfully
in `global` and deployed revision `driftline-00015-g9k`. The exact image
digest serving Cloud Run is
`sha256:71931430f64d9b54f43c6480a73fceaf705815dfd204709e0f737353dc832782`.
Cloud Build and Cloud Run may enable Google-managed dependency APIs in addition
to the six explicitly requested application APIs; no Driftline code uses the
unrelated managed services. No existing project, bucket, database, service
account, API key, repository, or environment variable is reused.

## Verified live evidence

The current public release was exercised on revision `driftline-00015-g9k`:

- `GET /health` returned `{"status":"ok","service":"driftline-agent","persistence":"firestore","async_jobs":true}`.
- A logged-out browser run completed the async scan at desktop width and at a
  true 390px device viewport; both had `bodyScrollWidth === innerWidth` and no
  horizontal overflow.
- Demo job `job-389cf5f6bcb2` reached `needs_approval` and created workflow
  `0758a051-cf20-4fab-93bc-da0b7ad5e696` from the public pricing snapshot.
  The persisted job recorded `model=gemini-3.5-flash`,
  `execution_mode=google_adk`, and only the allowlisted tools
  `inspect_source_change` and `get_workflow_state`; the source mode was
  `public_source` with a pinned snapshot URL and hash. The trace recorded
  `analysis.mode=gemini_structured`, a model summary/rationale, the matching
  evidence hash, and four artifacts. Approval created Firestore action record
  `action-c22cd1c2adef` (`active`), and undo changed that same record to
  `reversed`; the packet carries the action ID and status.
- The browser flow covered source-evidence modal, artifact selection, the
  deterministic human approval gate, per-artifact outcomes (`packet_ready`,
  `owner_review`, and `queued`), the evidence-bound sandbox packet, activity
  audit, and reopen/undo. The packet explicitly recorded that no external
  system was changed.
- Direct Firestore REST inspection found the matching job document, workflow
  document, and eight-document `audit_events` subcollection. Approval
  synchronized the job to `complete`; reopening synchronized it back to
  `needs_approval`.
- A signed Cloud Scheduler run created monitor job `job-9668cbe22717`, which
  completed `baseline_established` with no workflow or approval invented. The
  Firestore snapshot ledger contains one `public/pricing` baseline document.
- A controlled ledger replay created monitor job `job-2813b664a871`, which
  detected `changed` with the exact before/after sentences and
  `confidence=0.99`, then reached the same deterministic approval gate. Its
  explicit structured-analysis fallback was safe and labelled; the final
  judge-facing demo run above is the verified `gemini_structured` path.
- The source registry now exposes a second realistic public source type,
  `public/terms`, with its own pinned fixture and independent snapshot key;
  the console shows both bounded monitors without exposing arbitrary URL input.
- The artifact bucket is isolated from Cloud Build buckets and has no public
  IAM members. A successful approval writes a packet object; undo writes a
  separate rollback marker so the original object remains versioned evidence.
- The first post-deploy live run exposed and fixed an ADK mode incompatibility;
  one subsequent enqueue returned a transient queue-not-found while the
  service was warming. The final run succeeded; treat Cloud Run error logs as
  a release gate before submission.

The public live-agent endpoint is configured for at most 10 calls per hour and a
2,000-character query. Demo starts and approval/undo writes share a 30-mutation
hourly cap. These are spend guards, not production authentication.

## Cleanup and disablement

The following commands target only the Driftline project. Review the inventory
before running destructive commands and never paste credentials or tokens into
the repository:

```bash
PROJECT=driftline-hackathon-2026
REGION=us-central1

gcloud scheduler jobs delete driftline-monitor --project="$PROJECT" --location="$REGION"
gcloud iam service-accounts delete driftline-scheduler@$PROJECT.iam.gserviceaccount.com --project="$PROJECT"
gcloud run services delete driftline --project="$PROJECT" --region="$REGION"
gcloud tasks queues delete driftline-jobs --project="$PROJECT" --location="$REGION"
gcloud artifacts repositories delete driftline --project="$PROJECT" --location="$REGION"
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://724959673622-us-central1-cloudbuild-logs
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://driftline-hackathon-2026_us-central1_cloudbuild
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://driftline-hackathon-2026_cloudbuild
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://driftline-artifacts-724959673622
gcloud firestore databases delete --database='(default)' --project="$PROJECT"
gcloud projects delete "$PROJECT"
```

Project deletion is irreversible and should be the final reviewed action. The
free trial closes automatically on 2026-11-17 unless the full paid account is
activated; do not click the Cloud Console “Activate” upsell while the project
is no longer needed.
