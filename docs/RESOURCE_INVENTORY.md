# Driftline resource inventory

This inventory is intentionally scoped to the isolated Google Cloud project
`driftline-hackathon-2026`. The active gcloud configuration was checked during
the release run:

```text
core.account: mikeyerke@gmail.com
core.project: driftline-hackathon-2026
project number: 724959673622
```

Before any future mutation, verify the target explicitly:

```bash
gcloud config set project driftline-hackathon-2026
test "$(gcloud config get-value project 2>/dev/null)" = driftline-hackathon-2026
```

| Cloud Build compatibility bucket | `gs://driftline-hackathon-2026_cloudbuild` | Created by Cloud Build | Labels: `app=driftline`, `environment=build`, `hackathon=all-things-agentic` |
| GitHub repository | `https://github.com/mikeyerke/driftline` | Public, source matches deployed revision | Separate repository under existing user account; no organization created |

Cloud Build ID `2e07f172-3683-4b7b-868c-08c4984c17c5` completed successfully in
`us-central1`. Its Docker image digest is the exact image serving Cloud Run.
Cloud Build and Cloud Run may enable Google-managed dependency APIs in addition
to the six explicitly requested application APIs; no Driftline code uses the
unrelated managed services. No existing project, bucket, database, service
account, API key, repository, or environment variable is reused.

## Verified live evidence

- `GET /health` must return `status=ok`, Firestore persistence, and
  `async_jobs=true` on the release revision.
- Public browser QA must cover desktop and 390px widths with no horizontal
  overflow.
- The release run must cover the async scan, source evidence/hash, artifact
  selection, per-artifact decision, sandbox packet, reopening, and activity
  audit states against the public service.
- The release run must record `/api/jobs/{job_id}` with
  `model=gemini-3.5-flash`, `execution_mode=google_adk`, and the allowlisted
  tools `inspect_source_change` and `get_workflow_state`.
- Firestore inspection must find the job parent, workflow parent, and
  `audit_events` subcollection for the same job.
- Cloud Run revision logs must show successful task and browser requests with
  no unresolved application exceptions.

The public live-agent endpoint is configured for at most 10 calls per hour and a
2,000-character query. Demo starts and approval/undo writes share a 30-mutation
hourly cap. These are spend guards, not production authentication.

## Cleanup and disablement

The following commands target only the Driftline project. Review the inventory
before running destructive commands and never paste credentials or tokens into
the repository:

```bash
PROJECT=driftline-hackathon-2026
REGION=us-central1

gcloud run services delete driftline --project="$PROJECT" --region="$REGION"
gcloud tasks queues delete driftline-jobs --project="$PROJECT" --location="$REGION"
gcloud artifacts repositories delete driftline --project="$PROJECT" --location="$REGION"
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://724959673622-us-central1-cloudbuild-logs
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://driftline-hackathon-2026_us-central1_cloudbuild
gcloud storage buckets delete gs://driftline-hackathon-2026_cloudbuild
gcloud firestore databases delete --database='(default)' --project="$PROJECT"
gcloud projects delete "$PROJECT"
```

Project deletion is irreversible and should be the final reviewed action. The
free trial closes automatically on 2026-11-17 unless the full paid account is
activated; do not click the Cloud Console “Activate” upsell while the project
is no longer needed.
